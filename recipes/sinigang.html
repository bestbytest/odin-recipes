    <h2>Laswa Recipe</h2>

    <p>This is not my recipe. <a href = "https://panlasangpinoy.com/laswa-recipe/#recipe">Check the original source here.</a></p>

    <p>Laswa is essentially a boiled vegetable soup of the most varied, but harmonious set of ingredients.
         This actually originated in Iloilo, and it is often compared to another vegetable-filled soup dish called Dinengdeng.
          Both use heaps of vegetables to complete the dish. And some versions of Laswa also make use of bagoong.
          But Dinengdeng contains less vegetables, and is actually from Ilocos.
          Laswa ingredients, meanwhile, rely mainly on the vegetables, themselves to provide the flavor and texture.</p>
